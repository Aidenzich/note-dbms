| **Parametric End Users** | **Parametric End Users** are the unsophisticated(樸實無華) who don't have any DBMS knowledge but they frequently use the database applications in their daily life to get the desired results. For examples, Railway's ticket booking users are naive users. </br>(中：不具有DBMS相關知識但經常使用資料庫為基礎的應用程式的用戶) |
| **Views** | A database view is **a subset of a database and is based on a query** that runs on one or more database tables. </br> (中： View是基於 query 資料庫的子集) |
| **Support of mutiple views of the data** | - Each user may see a different view of the database, which describes only the data of interest to that user </br> - It may also contain some **virtual data that is derived from the database files but its not explicitly stored**. </br> (中：每個用戶都擁有各自的資料庫視圖。且可能含有由資料庫內資料所推導出來的虛擬資料) |
| **Program-data independence** | The ability to modify the scheme without affecting the programs and the application to be rewritten. </br> Data is separated from the programs, so that the changes made to the data will **not affect the program execution and the application**. </br> (中：對數據做的改變不會影響應用的執行) |
